-        <h2>About This Film</h2>
-        <p>As an AI engineer and sci-fi author, Anno is not the most obvious politician. Until last year, he had no experience in politics. Following a surprising 2.5% vote share in the 2024 Tokyo Gubernatorial Election, Anno sets his sights on a greater challenge - winning a parliamentary seat. His campaign represents a bold attempt to shake up Japan’s political landscape, confronting a system that has been dominated by a single party for over six decades. Anno’s challenge is twofold. He must overcome the inertia of a political establishment resistant to change, while simultaneously embodying the “broad listening” approach that forms the core of his platform. This will mean engaging with all facets of Japanese society. On one hand, an aging population, deeply rooted in tradition, views his tech-driven solutions with skepticism. On the other, a younger generation remain largely apathetic, their attention fragmented and captured by the very technology Anno seeks to harness for democratic purposes.</p>

+        <h2>Film Synopsis</h2>
+        <p><strong>Title: Broad Listening</strong></p>
+        <p>In a Japan grappling with an aging population, political apathy, and a stagnant system, AI engineer and science fiction author Takahiro Anno launches a new political party, Team Mirai. Their goal: to upgrade democracy for the digital age.</p>
+        <p>Broad Listening is a sci-fi documentary that operates on two planes. First, it offers an intimate, present-day portrait of Anno and his team of young engineers as they build open-source tools to make politics more transparent and participatory. The film follows their real-world struggle to implement their vision of "broad listening"—systematically gathering diverse public opinions to shape policy—within the rigid confines of Japanese politics.</p>
+        <p>Second, the film ventures into the near future. In a series of co-created, speculative sci-fi scenes, it visualizes the world that Team Mirai is fighting for. This future is not a technological dystopia, but a "shared reality" where digital tools have successfully created a more meaningful and deeply engaged democracy. By weaving together today's political reality with tomorrow's possibilities, Broad Listening explores whether technology can truly bridge our divides and build a more collaborative future.</p>

+        <h2>Topic Summary: The Digital Democracy Movement</h2>
+        <p><strong>Further Context: The Global Digital Democracy Movement</strong></p>
+        <p>Takahiro Anno's work is part of a growing global movement using technology to reinvent democratic processes. For decades, digital tools like social media have often amplified polarization. This new wave of "civic tech" aims to do the opposite: build systems designed for consensus and collaboration.</p>
+        <p>A core philosophical guide for this movement is the book <em>Plurality</em>, co-authored by Taiwan's first Digital Minister, Audrey Tang, and economist Glen Weyl. It argues for designing technology that bridges social differences and harnesses diversity as a strength for progress.</p>
+        <p>The most prominent real-world example is vTaiwan, a pioneering project in Taiwan. It's a hybrid online-offline process where citizens, experts, and government officials deliberate on complex national issues. Using tools like Polis, vTaiwan has successfully forged consensus on contentious topics like Uber regulation and AI governance.</p>
+        <p>Polis itself is a key innovation. Developed by the non-profit Computational Democracy Project, it's a survey and discussion platform that uses machine learning not to maximize engagement, but to identify areas of "group-informed consensus" that cut across different opinion groups.</p>
+        <p>In Japan, this movement is gaining traction. Anno's political party, Team Mirai, and his non-partisan Digital Democracy 2030 project are applying these principles to the Japanese context, developing open-source tools for political transparency and citizen deliberation. Elsewhere, municipalities like Kakogawa City are experimenting with platforms like Decidim to involve citizens in local planning. These efforts represent a shared global experiment to build a more responsive, resilient, and participatory democracy for the 21st century.</p>
